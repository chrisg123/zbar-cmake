ZBAR BAR CODE READER
====================

ZBar Bar Code Reader is an open source software suite for reading bar
codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw
intensity sensors. It supports EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128,
Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.  Included with the library
are basic applications for decoding captured bar code images and using

developers, language bindings are included for C, C++, Python and Perl
as well as GUI widgets for Qt, GTK and PyGTK.
